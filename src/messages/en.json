    "content": "<p>I was born in Germany and I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Texas A&M University. In my free time, I like being creative by making music. But I also listen to a lot of music (Spotify says I am a vampire since it is mostly techno but I also listen to Jazz and soul-soothing music if I want to relax). Cooking, gaming, and sometimes just enjoying precious time with friends are other free time activities of mine. I also enjoy visiting art exhibitions and museums. I have proficiency in speaking English and German.</p><Quote>You can build whatever you desire by learning the principles of code once.</Quote><p>Do not get me wrong: Learning how to code is a lifelong process. There is so much to learn that you will never be proficient in all different areas at the same time. But during my time studying computer science, I fell in love with the idea of having all the necessary tools in hand to build something that helps people out there and possibly also yourself. The possibilities and options are endless and once you dig deeper you soon notice that it takes a whole lot to understand the various abstractions that are built on top of bare metal machines. Looking back I must say that I would always take the same route again when it comes to learning how to code. Understanding the underlying methodology and design patterns is key to being able to adapt quickly in this fast-paced industry. Obviously, it was not always easy and I also criticize the curricula of established universities that they think are suited for people who want to go into the industry. I could write a whole book about what is good and bad about the way universities teach but that is for another day.</p>",

      "text": "I have worked in a professional setting and have 6 years of experience overall taking my computer science degrees into account. I focused on frontend development in recent years. I became proficient in writing JavaScript and various associated frameworks like Vue and React or higher abstraction frameworks like Nuxt and Next; there is also an obsession with CSS going on. It is just too powerful not to mention. It is just beautiful to see the finished work on a screen. During my studies, I also worked with several backend frameworks like Flask in Python or Express in JavaScript and therefore with database systems like PostgreSQL. If I am doing freelance work I mostly use the Adobe Creative Suite with Illustrator and XD to develop design ideas.",
