            "The psychological magazine aware gives psychology students of the University of Zurich a voice. It creates a space to critically question psychological concepts and the latest research but also offers students a way to show their various creative skills besides their chosen study program. The magazine consists of multiple departments, each of them responsible for a different part of the end product. With joined forces they deliver a beautifully illustrated magazine every semester. You can find it at multiple locations around the city of Zurich.",
            "I felt honored that they had entrusted me with rebuilding their website. Together, we wanted to build another pillar for the magazine to stand on. The printed magazine should still remain the main focus while having another way of engaging with interested readers. In order to reach out to a wider audience a website that resembles the magazine in an authentic way was essential. To reach that goal I worked hand in hand together with the magazineâ€™s layout department to build a new digital experience."
