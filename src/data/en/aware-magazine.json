            "The magazine aware gives psychology students of the University of Zurich a voice. It creates a space to critically question psychological concepts and the latest research and offers students a way to show their various creative skills besides their chosen study program. The magazine consists of multiple departments, each of them responsible for a different part of the end product. With joined forces, they deliver a beautifully illustrated magazine every semester. You can find it at multiple locations around the city of Zurich.",
            "I felt honored that the aware team had entrusted me with rebuilding their website. Together, we built another pillar for the magazine to stand on. The printed magazine remains the main focus while the new website offers another way of engaging with interested readers. A website that resembles the magazine in an authentic way is essential to reach out to a wider audience. To achieve that goal, I worked together with the magazineâ€™s layout department to build a new digital experience."
