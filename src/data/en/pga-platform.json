            "This project was the main aspect of my Bachelorâ€™s thesis. It is about new and creative ways to do data visualization. Almost everyone should be familiar with the fact that mobility causes emissions. Especially in urban areas where there is much traffic at rush hour. I wanted to make those emissions visible because they can harm the people living in the city. In order to do that I wanted to develop a platform that allows me as a developer to write an algorithm that draws something creative on the screen and integrate that algorithm with an already existing architecture."

After development, I showcased the platform using a space colonization algorithm as an example. This specific algorithm was drawing 3D trees that were influenced by the given emission levels. For example, you could set up the algorithm so that it draws the tree much shorter and in red color if there was a lot of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the air. The platform essentially does the mapping between measurement and algorithm parameters."
